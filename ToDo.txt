Assignment :

 

You can use any Python3 framework and database (MongoDB preferred). Do share the source code on Github or similar service. Also host the app on the service of your choice.


Develop a web app to stream music from remote source, hosted on a server.

It should have basic functionality for play, pause, next, previous and seek.

When the respective buttons are clicked, it should log events in a database as well as text file (csv) capturing important info like
timestamp, trackId, userId, play button click time, pause time, total number of seconds he/she listened too. Feel free to add events/actions that you think it would be useful.

This file should be helpful to trace user actions and serve as a basic analytics.

Use the captured info and display it in basic dashboard (need not be UI intensive).

Generate basic report using the captured events.

Do create useful REST API's for the above task to build the dashboard and WebApp. 
API's should have proper error handling and response codes in different scenarios.
